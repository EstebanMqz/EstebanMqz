Dear Hiring Manager

I want to express my deepest interest in [Escape Velocity AI Engineer] vacancy in with a strong background in Statistical Modelling combined with Data Science as a Financial Engineer which has allowed me to be #50 in GitHub within Mexico, being the most used open-source platform for coding but I am just experienced in 15+ languages but as you can see in my CV, specially in Matlab, Python & R.

I've applied my experience working for the INEGI to more real world financial challenges with Data as a Geographical Information Systems Specialist and obtain an avg yearly return of 30% in the Housing Market within Mexico consecutively automatically HTTP querying Gentrification using Remote Sensed Data with Satellite Imagery to identify with Machine Learning growing housing market trends.

I have a little bit more than 120+ keybindings & 200 configurations remotely diposable from anywhere in the world preferably using VSCode simply in the web assuring X return for investors with the tech through self-speaking Dashboards 
or simply having the data processed and the models trained how it results better as this can't be automated.

I was also among the earliest adopters of GitHub Copilot (beta), way before OpenAI Chat GPT I was generating all kinds of language's scripts with a single sentence written which output changed with a single symbol as well as documenting it, and quickly verifying or fixing if it's not magically correct which was mostly not the case but I have zero problems fixing it with my expertise.

I had the pleasure to obtain an A+ in the AI course instructed by the director of the Math & Physics Department in my university to finish the last semester of the first BSc. of Financial Engineering in Mexico in the university called ITESO, a world-wide recognized Jesuit institution. 

Despite my abilities to make ETL processes with any kind of Data I decided to study a semester in Economics in Europe because of the Game Theory's instructor who came and went from Seville to Rome day by day to Loyola's Leadership School which means so I am not also very social but know casi-no-s entirely as well. 
Humour which results immoral or unethical wouldn't be AI generated for e.g. Unless you know the algorithms and under a deadline need to develop even optimized portfolios price prediction models with all stock markets or Big data ETL processes with Unsupervised learning algorithms.

I am participating in the GitHub Models Beta and now an expert in PowerShell to further develop my Cloud abilities within Software, Infrastructure and Platform as services to pay just for the necessary computing power & have an organization be way more cost efficient. 

I am available for an interview at an hour of your convenience and can be reached through the contact details.


Best regards,
EstebanMqz
