Dear Hiring Manager

I want to express my deepest interest in Data Instuctor LATAM vacancy in with a strong background in Statistical Modelling combined with Data Science as a Financial Engineer which has allowed me to be #50 in GitHub within México, being the most used open-source platform for coding in 15+ coding languages but but as you can see in my CV, specially in Matlab, Python & R.

I've applied my experience working for the INEGI to more real world financial challenges with Data as a Geographical Information Systems Specialist and obtain an avg yearly return of 30% in the Housing Market within México consecutively. You can check out some of my gists https://gist.github.com/EstebanMqz/starred to see my customized 120+ keybindings & 200 configurations remotely from anywhere in the world with access to the web assuring delivery within tight deadlines.

I was among the earliest adopters of GitHub Copilot (beta), way before OpenAI Chat GPT i was generating scripts with a single sentence told to AI, document it, and quickly verify or fix if it's correct or complete. During the situation I had the pleasure to obtain an A+ in the AI course instructed by the director of the Math & Physics Department in my university to finish the last semester of the first BSc. of Financial Engineering in Mexico in ITESO, a world-wide recognized Jesuit institution. 

Despite my abilities to make ETL processes with any kind of Data I decided to study a semester in Economics in Europe because of the Game Theory's instructor who came and went from Seville to Rome day by day Loyola's Leadership School. 

I am also participating in the GitHub Models Beta and now an expert in PowerShell to further develop my Cloud abilities within Software, Infrastructure and Platform as services to have the necessary computing power and be more cost efficient. 

I'm currently developing optimizations with scikit-learn with UX/UI designs (user-friendly apps) for all stock markets in the world in real-time to develop portfolios depending on the objectives of the investor which are all Mathematically explained, as well as the utilization of Python libraries to verify its trustworthiness.

I am available for an interview at an hour of your convenience and can be reached through the contact details.

Best regards,
EstebanMqz
